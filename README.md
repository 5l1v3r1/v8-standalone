# v8 standalone

The goal of this project is to provide an "easy" way to embed V8 in whatever project you want (including an operating system&ndash;hint hint). Ultimately, this will include overloading various C++ operators and calling back to your plugin code.  Additionally, this will implement the various standard C++ library functions which V8 requires.

# building

I'm pretty sure I'm going to use make, but besides that, just stay tuned.
